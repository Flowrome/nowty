## Translation files

You can find the translation files under `apps/backend/statics/langs/*.json`, you can also add your language by providing your json file and put in the folder with the language short name like `apps/backend/statics/langs/fr.json`.
The frontend application should use the browser language, if nothing has been found it will rely on the `OV_FE_DEFAULT_LANG` you set in the `docker-compose.yaml` file args
